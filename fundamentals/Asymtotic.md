# The Growth of Functions

There are several kind of functions recently appear in algorithm analysis and design.

In this section we will cover some basic knowledge in mathematical functions as well as number theory

# The Maximum-Subarray Problem

Suppose we have to maximize profit by either buying at the lowest price or selling at the highest price. We can consider the daily change in price, where the change on day i is the difference between the prices after day i-1 and after day i. For instances, the table below shows daily changes.

|     | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A   | 13  | -3  | -25 | 20  | -3  | -16 | -23 | 18  | 20  | -7  | 12  | -5  | -22 | 15  | -4  | 7   |

The maximum subarray in this case is A[8..11], with sum 43, has the greatest sum of any contiguous subarray of array A
